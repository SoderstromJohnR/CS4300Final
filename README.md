# CS 4300 Final Project
Final Report and Notebooks

The notebooks seem to get stuck where I uploaded the data, so links for each of them follow:

Final Project CS4300: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1V7CcP5j0CAPeRGAGOF_8y3uqjeW2o18u

Messy Project: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iIyWl9gN59tIYsQQJdMRHg5dpNRCvGmJ

The Final Report pdf contains a somewhat simplified version of my original report to reduce it to under 10 pages. The resulting document is 7 pages and adds some consideration for modeling off of inputs that can be known earlier, before the output would be known.

The Phase 3 Report contains the older and longer version I turned in for part 3.

The Messy Project notebook contains all of the code used throughout the project. It is not well organized, but will contain more information outside of the last consideration in my final report.

The Final Project CS4300 notebook is better organized and contains code used in the final report. While it does not contain as much information as the other notebook, someone new to it could understand it much more easily.
